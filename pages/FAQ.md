### What security measures does sgID provide?
sgID employs end-to-end encryption, and does not store any of your data that passes through our servers. Even in the case of a data breach, your data will never be compromised because it remains safely on your phone, in your control.

### Is sgID a government endorsed solution?
Yes. sgID is a government initiative, and it is currently integrated into the Singpass App. 

### Where can I use sgID?
If you're a government officer or business, you can reach out to the sgID team to start authenticating users for free. Simply fill in this form: https://go.gov.sg/sgid-contact

If you are a member of the public, there is no need to onboard to sgID, you simply have to ensure that you have Singpass App installed to log into services with sgID. 

### How is sgID different from Singpass?
sgID is a part of Singpass. The main difference between sgID login and normal Singpass login lies in the underlying technical implementation.

Do note that if your service or form is using sgID, users can **only** sign in through Singpass App. There is currently no password log in option on sgID.

### Is sgID compliant with PDPA?

Yes. The PDPA requires businesses to be compliant with clauses by 1 September 2019, surrounding consent obligation, purpose limitation obligation, and notification obligation, all of which are built into our solution, sgID. Please visit the PDPC site for more information on the legislation, guidelines, exemption, and enforcement of the PDPA.
